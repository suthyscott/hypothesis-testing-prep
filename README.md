What exactly is Hypothesis testing?

Goals:
- Define hypothesis testing
- Why use hypothesis testing?
- How it works

Lesson wrap up and summary:

What is a hypothesis?
- a statement that asserts why something happened or what might happen, that is then evaluated and proven true or false. 
- "A hypothesis is an idea that can be tested" Where the idea is specific and measurable.
- "If I flip a light switch, the light will turn on." Then find a way to prove or disprove the theory.

Hypothesis testing:
- Making an assumption (stating a hypothesis) aand using statistical data to prove how accurate it is.
- I go out and survey 10 people to see if their lights turn on when they flip a switch. 



### The Hypotheses

Null hypothesis:
- The obstacle or the anti-hypothesis
- Let's say our light hasn't been working and flipping the switch has no effect. "Even after changing the bulb, flipping a switch will not turn on the light."

Alternative hypothesis:
- what you believe to be true or hope to prove.
- "If I flip a light switch, the light will turn on"

Null hypothesis is "innocent until proven guilty"; considered true until proven false. 

If we fail to reject the null hypothesis, we don't necessarily reject the alternative hypothesis. We simply determine that we don't have enough evidence to support it. 

### Steps of hypothesis testing
- State the hypotheses. This involves stating two competing hypotheses. The two hypotheses are named the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. 
- Formulate an analysis plan. The analysis plan describes how to use sample data to evaluate the null hypothesis. 
- Analyze sample data. 
- Interpret results. Apply the decision rule described in the analysis plan. 
    - A decision rule is a procedure that the researcher uses to decide whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis.
    - "If a majority of our responses suggest that resetting the breaker might help, we will reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis." 




Add an example of how this would apply to a software team. 

Can you think of an example in your current role where hypothesis testing would be useful? What would be the alternative hypothesis?
